.Sh NAME
.Nm gmlgpio
.Nd Intel Gemini Lake SoC GPIO controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device gpio"
.Cd "device gmlgpio"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
supports the GPIO controller that can be found in Intel's Gemini Lake SoC
family.
.Pp
The Gemini Lake SoC has 4 banks of GPIO pins, NORTHWEST, NORTH, AUDIO, and SCC.
All are exposed to userland as
.Pa /dev/gpiocN ,
where N is 0-3.
Pins in each bank are pre-named to match names in the Intel 
datasheets referenced below.
.Pp
This driver is based upon the chvgpio(4) Cherry View GPIO driver, and provides all
the intended functionality of that driver.
